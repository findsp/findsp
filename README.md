# FINDSP

FINDSP is the **Linux audio and software development front** for in-house systems running on **CTP-EOS Linux**. It is our primary platform for creating, experimenting with, and distributing audio software that spans open collaboration to private and commercial releases.

## Philosophy & Approach

We are focused on **truly mind-bending and mind-warping audio applications**.  

- Our software is designed to **affect the consciousness of the artists using it, their audiences downstream, and everyone participating in the CTP / CTP-EOS ecosystem**. - FINDSP is plugged into the **[CTPSci Sciences](linkedin.com/company/ctp-energy)**, the post-quantum / post-physics sciences of consciousness from the C-domain, and our work reflects that connection.  
- Experimentation and prototyping remain central, but all projects are aligned with **system-level audio innovation** and the broader **CTP-EOS platform**.

## Musical Context & Creative Alignment

FINDSP works at the intersection of **cutting-edge music, experimental sound, and cross-domain consciousness**. Our tools and projects are tailored for creators exploring:

- **[Algorave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave) & generative electronic**  
- **[Ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music) & [Dark Ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ambient) textures**  
- **[IDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music), [Psytrance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psytrance), [Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_trance), and [Industrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_music) soundscapes**  
- Experimental audio workflows for post-quantum / C-domain-informed consciousness experiences  

We aim to **hook artists and audiences** in these communities, providing software that is **both a technical platform and a creative amplifier**, shaping sound, perception, and experience.

## Tech Stack & Common Tools

Developers working with FINDSP are expected to be familiar with:

- **[Cabbage](https://cabbageaudio.com/)** – for VST and audio plugin development  
- **[JUCE](https://juce.com/)** – Producer framework for modular and cross-platform audio applications  
- **CMake / GlibC** – standard build systems for Linux audio software  

### Core Linux Libraries & Dependencies
- ALSA / JACK (audio I/O)  
- libsndfile, PortAudio, FFTW, RtAudio (signal processing)  
- GTK or Qt (optional GUI modules)  
- GCC / Clang, Git, Make, Python scripting (for build automation)  
- Optional / research-oriented: OpenGL, Vulkan, or other graphics libs for UI visualization, audio-reactive displays

## Distribution & Licensing

Our releases span multiple models:

- Open-source (GPL or similar)  
- Freeware / donationware  
- Full commercial audio software  

While fully supportive of open-source collaboration, FINDSP retains internal control over select projects, ensuring alignment with **CTP-EOS Linux** systems.

## Footer / Vision

Our audio and software are intended to enhance the consciousness of users and their audiences, and to support connection with **extraterrestrial and off-world consciousness**.  
Designed to expand perception, influence consciousness, and explore **cross-domain awareness**.
