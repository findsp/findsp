# FINDSP

FINDSP is the **Linux audio and software development front** for in-house systems running on **CTP-EOS Linux**. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/ctp-eos" target="_blank">CTP-EOS</a> is our primary platform for creating, experimenting with, and distributing audio software that spans open collaboration to private and commercial releases. CTP-EOS isn't just Linux—***"CTP-EOS™ is the Conscious OS!"*** FINDSP is the audio gateway to the C-domain.

---

## Philosophy & Approach

We are focused on **truly mind-bending and mind-warping audio applications**.  

- Our software is designed to **affect the consciousness of the artists using it, their audiences downstream, and everyone participating in the CTP / CTP-EOS ecosystem**.
- FINDSP is plugged into the **[CTPSci Sciences](https://linkedin.com/company/ctp-energy)** the post-quantum / post-physics sciences of consciousness from the C-domain, and our work reflects that connection.  
- Experimentation and prototyping remain central, but all projects are aligned with **system-level audio innovation** and the broader **CTP-EOS platform**.
- Note: all FINDSP software is originally developed on Linux.
- Future FINDSP releases will be available on most major platforms, though our brand identity is *Linux-centric*.

## Musical Context & Creative Alignment

FINDSP works at the intersection of **cutting-edge music, experimental sound, and cross-domain consciousness**. Our tools and projects are tailored for creators exploring:

- **[Algorave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave) & generative electronic**  
- **[Ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music) & [Dark Ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ambient) textures**  
- **[IDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music), [Psytrance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psytrance), [Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_trance), and [Industrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_music) soundscapes**  
- Experimental audio workflows for post-quantum / C-domain-informed consciousness experiences  

We aim to **hook artists and audiences** in these communities, providing software that is **both a technical platform and a creative amplifier**, shaping sound, perception, and experience.

## Tech Stack & Common Tools

Developers working with FINDSP are expected to be familiar with:

- **[JUCE](https://juce.com/)** – Producer framework for modular and cross-platform audio applications  
- **[Cabbage](https://cabbageaudio.com/)** – for VST and audio plugin development  
- **CMake / GlibC** – standard build systems for Linux audio software  

### Core Linux Libraries & Dependencies
- ALSA / JACK (audio I/O)  
- libsndfile, PortAudio, FFTW, RtAudio (signal processing)  
- GTK or Qt (optional GUI modules)  
- GCC / Clang, Git, Make, Python scripting (for build automation)  
- Optional / research-oriented: OpenGL, Vulkan, or other graphics libs for UI visualization, audio-reactive displays

## Distribution & Licensing

Our releases span multiple models:

- Open-source (GPL or similar)  
- Freeware / donationware  
- Full commercial audio software  

While fully supportive of open-source collaboration via the FINDSP Audio Group (FINDSPAG), FINDSP retains internal control over it's own internal select projects, ensuring alignment with **CTP-EOS Linux** systems, where applicable and especially where our own interally developed software and licensing issues are concered.

## FINDSP Audio Group (FINDSPAG)

**[<a href="https://github.com/FINDSP-Audio-Group" target="_blank">FINDSP Audio Group (FINDSPAG)</a>](https://github.com/FINDSP-Audio-Group)** is a federation of developers, engineers, and audio innovators collaborating under the CTP umbrella. Think of it as a **hub where contributions, projects, and tools are organized, listed, and easily discoverable**.  

We focus on **audio technology, music software, and hardware integration**, building everything from **chiptune sequencers and modular synth editors to legacy sampler modernization tools**.   

Our work bridges **classic hardware workflows with modern Linux/MIDI environments**, combining precision engineering, creative sound design, and open-source accessibility to empower musicians, producers, and developers alike.  

---

## Footer / Vision

Our audio and software are intended to enhance the consciousness of users and their audiences, and to support connection with **extraterrestrial and off-world consciousness**.  
Designed to expand perception, influence consciousness, and explore **cross-domain awareness**.

# ACTIVE PROJECTS

## Tutka 1.1.3 – Modern CTP-EOS/Debian/Arch/Linux MIDI Tracker 🐉    

![Tutka Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/findsp/tutka/main/images/tutka_screenshot.png)

### About the Project

Revitalized for 2026, <a href="https://github.com/findsp/tutka" target="_blank">Tutka</a> is a lightweight, **MIDI-only tracker sequencer** designed for GNU/Linux (Debian 13+ tested, Mac OS X source available). With full support for Tutka and OctaMED song formats, plus standard MIDI, it seamlessly integrates with hardware synths or software via ALSA/JACK/PipeWire. This release adds a ready-to-run binary, modern Qt5 compatibility, and streamlined build paths, making it **the fastest way to sequence retro-inspired music on modern systems**.

## PlayerPRO Linux Port

![PlayerPRO Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/findsp/PlayerPRO/master/images/1.jpeg)

### About the Project

**PlayerPRO** is a classic MAC tracker, famously used in Aphex Twin's *Vordhosbn* track.  

We are actively working to bring **PlayerPRO to Linux**, with the following goals:

- Fully working Linux port of the original PlayerPRO tracker  
- New Makefile for Linux compilation  
- Full Linux compatibility with **all original PlayerPRO plugins**  
- Possible inclusion of SDK or resources for developers to create additional plugins

## Contributing

We are looking for **developers and enthusiasts** to help realize this Linux port. If you have experience with:

- Linux software development  
- Makefile setup  
- Audio plugin development  

…we’d love your contributions!

## Links

- [FINDSP: PlayerPro Project Repository](https://github.com/findsp/PlayerPRO)


Linux support has been added, but the makefile is bare-bones and plug-ins are currently not being built.  
(via the original host/project). This project exists for extending these purposes and goals.
